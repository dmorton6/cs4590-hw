# CS 4590 HW
This repo includes my implementation for two of the three homework projects for CS 4590 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. HW 2 was done in JavaScript and used the jQuery UI, while HW 3 was involved C# scripting for a 3D scene using the {Unity}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28game_engine%29] game engine.
